  - The writing style is great. Sentences are short and clearly written. Grammar
    is spot on. Well done!
  - I really enjoy how each step leads into the next. The flow is well thought
    out.
  - The conclusion styling everything with the seed color is a nice "good bye"
    and final demonstration of how the Theme keeps everything tidy.
  - Overall, this is a fantastic workshop. I've tried to provide feedback
    inline, but there wasn't much to improve :)
  - Total time to take the workshop, including writing feedback: 1hr 6 mins
