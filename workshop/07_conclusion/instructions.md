# Well done!

In this workshop you learned about:

* Styling with `Theme` and `MaterialApp` widgets
* Ways to create and customize `ThemeData` object
* Customizing texts and icons
* Styling buttons and text inputs
* Customizing scaffolds and app bars
  
The goal of this workshop was to show how it is possible to customize different widget types. However, you don't necessarily have to do this. The snippet on the right contains all widgets we styled in this workshop. Everything is customized by providing the generated `ColorScheme` only, and it already looks stylish, doesn't it? And if you have access to a professional designer or want to experiment - `ThemeData` is there to help you with consistency. 

## What's next

* `ThemeData` object has many more fields dedicated to configuring various aspects of the application design. Check out the [*documentation*](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ThemeData-class.html) to learn more.  
* Also read about [*Material design*](https://m3.material.io/), especially about [*Color schemes*](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/the-color-system/color-roles).
* Watch the [*"MaterialStateProperties" episode*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CylXr3AF3uU) of the [*Decoding Flutter*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjxrf2q8roU1fRV40Ec8200rX6OuQkmnl) series.
    
Good luck in mastering Flutter!
